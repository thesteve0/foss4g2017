== Other things we can get to if we have time

=== .NET builds

[source, bash]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore/master/dotnet_imagestreams.json -n openshift

oc new-app dotnet:1.0~https://github.com/thesteve0/DayTraderDotNet.git --name winning

=== Adding middleware templates
An admin has to do this one since it is writing to the _openshift_ namespace

[source, bash]
----
oc replace -n openshift --force -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/master/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.4/xpaas-streams/jboss-image-streams.json

=== Tomcat and EAP directory structure

Since images need to be compiled to make changes, this would cause a lot of
hassle for typical tasks for Java Web Developers. For example, we often need to
make changes to _server.xml_. Our native source to image builders actually let you handle these changes in your code repository.

Here is Tomcat:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html/red_hat_jboss_web_server_for_openshift/get_started

and here is EAP:

=== ConfigMap/Secret examples

ConfigMaps and Secrets are the recommended method to share configuration settings and environment variables within an application. They are separate objects in OpenShift that act like a key/value object that you can attach to deployments.

To look at an example in practice let's go back and look at our template application.

* First we look at the parameters being defined:

https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json#L464

* Then we look at the secret being defined:

https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json#L15

* Now we see it used in the DB

https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json#L411

* And then in the Frontend

https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json#L255

In the Web UI it can be found under Resources -> Secrets. If we change a value here it is automatically changed in all the pods.

Let's take a look there.


=== Service accounts

Sometimes you need to programatically talk to the OpenShift API without being authenticated as a user. An example might be having code that dynamically config pieces of the application depending on the status of things in the project.

Here is the doc talking about it:

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/dev_guide/service_accounts.html

To see the service accounts you have access to by default, and the details about the account, use the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
$  oc get sa
NAME       SECRETS   AGE
builder    2         2h
default    2         2h
deployer   2         2h

$ oc get sa default -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
imagePullSecrets:
- name: default-dockercfg-nbrh4
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2017-06-12T05:20:50Z
  name: default
  namespace: developer
  resourceVersion: "2664"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/developer/serviceaccounts/default
  uid: e5e695ab-4f2e-11e7-9c70-42010a8a0005
secrets:
- name: default-dockercfg-nbrh4
- name: default-token-279tx
