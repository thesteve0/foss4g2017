  Login - done
  Running a Docker image - done
  Running PostGIS - need - same data as the class
    Load the YAML from the stateful set
    Then Load the data
  Running GeoServer - need - same layers as in class
    Load the YAML

Next steps
go through all the steps and put in commands/screenshots as I do it
Find the shapefile I used to create a layer for molw
Export them as postgis files - need to project first
