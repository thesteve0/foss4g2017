== Adding GeoServer

Now that we have the database all set, let's go ahead and add our geospatial server
into our project. *DO NOT* delete anything from the project.

For those of you who don't know much about GeoServer, you can read http://geoserver.org/[more here].
Today we are only going to the very minimal install and usage of GeoServer, I highly recommend
you attend more training to see all the power that GeoServer can offer you in your work (and it's a ton of fun!).

=== Deploying GeoServer

Just like with the DB pieces we are going to pass in some JSON to have Kubernetes/OpenShift spin up a container to
start up GeoServer, along with some Persistent Volumes for storing the data directory.

We don't need to enable a service account here because there is no "clustering" between our geoserver
instances.

[source, bash]
----

$ oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thesteve0/geoserver-fedora/master/openshift/geoserver.json

----

Geoserver will take a LONG time to come up, as in more than 5 minutes, so please be patient. You will probably need to refresh the overview page
Several times to see if it really comes up.

Once the pod circle fills in blue, go ahead and click the _create route_ link on the top right like we did with NGINX.
Go ahead and accepts the defaults for the route. When finished go ahead and click on your brand new shiny URL and you
should be greeted with this:

The username and password are admin:geoserver, had your lazy instructor had planned better he could have made these variables
things you could set when loading the JSON file. I will explain in class.

=== Connecting to PostGIS

There are currently no data sources set up for GeoServer, for those of you who are familiar with GeoServer think about why this might be.
Let's go ahead and connect to our PostGIS we set up before.

First step is to create a Workspace, then a store, then a layer.

==== Adding Workspace & DataStore & Layer
Go ahead and click on the *+* next to the Workshop and red number 1.

For the name you can pick anything you want, though I would suggest "steveisgreat". For the namespace URI
you can put any URI you want it won't matter for today's exercise, I used http://thisis.a.org. Also go ahead and check "Default Workspace".

You should also check the boxes on the right side for WMTS, WFS, and WMS. When you have done this be sure to click "Save".

Then click over on the left vertical menu on Stores.

Click on the "Add new store" with the green *+* symbol. On the next screen pick PostGIS - NOT PostGIS (JNDI).

On the next screen is where we fill in all the vital information.

Please make sure you call the datasource name "postgis-reader", we are going to connect this to the replica service so it should
only be used for reading from the database. You can say that in the description if you want.

Leave the driver type as postgis and the port as 5432 BUT we need to change the host for the name for the replica service, which is _pg_replica_. The
database is userdb, the username is postgres, and the password is password. Your screen should end up looking like this:

image::common/geoserver_dbscreen.png[]

Once it is filled in scroll down and hit save. This action should bring you to the *New Layer* screen, go ahead
and click on the _publish_ link to the left of parkpoints.

On this screen you set up all the things necessary to publish the layer. Most of the sensible
defaults are already set up for you EXCEPT we need to define the bounding box. Scroll down the screen to the Bounding box
section. Then click on the compute from data link and the compute from native bounds link.

Once you have done that you can scroll to the bottom and save. You have now published your first GeoServer layer.

=== Looking at Your Layer

Now on the left hand menu you should see an icon and link for "Layer Preview". Click that and you should see your layer listed. Go ahead and
click on the OpenLayers link and you should be greeted with:

Congrats you have just published and viewed your first layer. If you click on GML link you can see all the points and their attributes.

In class I will show you how we can hook up to the master service, access it through QGIS, and then see the changes in the reading service!

Let's go on to adding a simple web frontend.
