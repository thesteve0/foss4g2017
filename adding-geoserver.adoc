== Adding GeoServer

Now that we have the database all set, let's go ahead and add our geospatial server
into our project. *DO NOT* delete anything from the project.

For those of you who don't know much about GeoServer, you can read http://geoserver.org/[more here].
Today we are only going to the very minimal install and usage of GeoServer, I highly recommend
you attend more training to see all the power that GeoServer can offer you in your work.
