In order to provision a master replica of PostGIS we are basically going
to do dome oc commands. Do these in order on your machine from a command prompt.
Mare sure to do these in the same directory as the JSON files (which should
be the current directory)

1.
# create the service account used in the containers
oc create -f set-sa.json

2.
#Now grant that serviceAccount the proper permissions
oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts
oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts

3.
#Now load the database
oc create -f database.json
