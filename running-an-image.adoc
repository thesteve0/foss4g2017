== Running a Docker Container Image

Let's start by just running an NGINX server in OpenShift. By way of doing this
we will also introduce you to many of the major pieces in an OpenShift project.

We are going to move back and forth between the command line and the web UI so
please have them both ready to go and logged in as the user.

=== Create a Project

In order to get going we need to create a _project_ to hold all of the pieces
of our application(s). A _project_ is a materialized _namespace_ in Kubernetes
that provides permissions and access control between different users' resources.

The first thing we need to do as a user is create the _project_. Because project names have to be unique in a cluster, please pick a project name that is unique to you. We recommend the first part of your email address or your Kerberos username.

[source, bash]
----
$ oc new-project <kerberos username>
Now using project <kerberos username> on server "{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}".
...
----

We created a _project_ named {{PROJECT_NAME}} and all subsequent commands will be executed against this _project_.

There is a special _project_ that admins have access to in the cluster named
"openshift". Any templates (explained later) or other objects placed in this
project are available to all users of the cluster with read permissions.

To see all the projects that you have permissions to see go ahead and:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc get projects
----

=== Bringing in Docker Container Image from DockerHub

Typically you will not bring in images directly from DockerHub because of the
numerous flaws and vulnerabilities in DockerHub images. One big problem for
many images on DockerHub is that they run as _root_ user when it is not even
required. By default, an OpenShift cluster will not let you run images as
_root_.

We wanted to use the NGINX image put out by the
https://hub.docker.com/r/centos/nginx-16-centos7/[CentOS group], but it requires
the root privilege which is not allowed on our cluster, so we built a custom
https://hub.docker.com/r/mjelen/nginx-summit/[image] just for this class.
Bringing this into our OpenShift environment is as simple as

[source, bash]
----
$ oc new-app docker.io/mjelen/nginx-summit

--> Found Docker image c04a8bc (6 minutes old) from docker.io for "docker.io/mjelen/nginx-summit"

    * An image stream will be created as "nginx-summit:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "nginx-summit"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "nginx-summit"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "nginx-summit"
    * WARNING: Image "docker.io/mjelen/nginx-summit" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream "nginx-summit" created
    deploymentconfig "nginx-summit" created
    service "nginx-summit" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

The command `oc new-app` actually does a lot of things for you. The idea behind
new-app is to "do the right thing" when given a non-OpenShift artifact, we like
to call it `oc translate`. So in this case we are telling OpenShift, "here is a
Docker image, do your best to make all the pieces needed to make this run as a
user would expect in OpenShift.

If you go back to the Web UI and look in the webpages project you should see
something like this (may take a while depending on the time it takes to
download the Docker image):

image::common/6_one_docker_image.png[]

Now is a good time to reflect back on the architecture diagram we explained
earlier and think about the objects created above. Let's start from the pod and work our way up to _Services_ and _Deployment Configurations_.

=== Making a Route to our Service

It's all well and fine that we have this pod running and fronted by a service
to do load balancing and proxying, but how do we actually expose this to the
outside world? This is where the OpenShift Route can be used to expose our
service with a URL.

In the Web UI, there is a link in the top right of NGINX SUMMIT titled
"Create Route". Go ahead and click it and accept all the defaults.

When you get back to the overview screen you will now have a URL up in the top
of the box, go ahead and click (but be ready for sadness).

image::common/6_one_docker_with_route.png[]

The resulting page gives you a 403 error message because there is no html
content in the mapped volume. This Docker container specified a mapped volume
to hold its HTML content and we never populated it with files. For this
exercise we will go in manually to the image and create some content.

=== Opening a Terminal Into the Pod

In the web UI click on the circle that says 1 pod, then click on the only pod
in the list. This will bring you to the detailed description page for the pod.
On that page please click on the Terminal tab.

image::common/6_open_terminal.png[]

What you have in front of you is a shell inside the running container. To create a HTML page that will be served up by NGINX just do
the following command (you can use tab completion to fill in the elements on
the path):

[source, bash]
----
echo "hello world" > html/index.html
----

Now if you go back and reload the URL you will see "hello world" in your
browser. But since Docker containers are immutable and the path we mounted for
storage was a host path, this page will go away if we deploy a new image or the
 image is destroyed.

You may have noticed the _overview_ page that there was a warning about
"No health checks defined". In the next section we will discuss what these
warnings mean and how to fix it.

Before you go on, please let the instructor know you are done with this section.
Once enough people are finished we will stop and have a discussion, but feel free
to keep moving forward.
