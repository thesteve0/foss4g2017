== Introduction to the OpenShift Environment

Before we get started, we have already installed the OpenShift client tools on
the VM for today's class.

If not you can get them here:

https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.5.1

Get the client file, unpackage, and put the _oc_ binary somewhere on your filesystem so it is in your path.

We have also spun up a cluster "in the cloud" for you to work on today. You will be interacting as developers, not system administrators.

=== The command line
And with that we begin the journey. Our first step will be to login to the OpenShift cluster
both from the command line (cli) and the web console (console). Open a terminal
and type in:

[source, bash]
----
> oc login {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}

# on windows or if you get a cert. error do the following

> oc login {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}} --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
----

You should be prompted for a username and password. Your username is the email address you used to sign up for the class and
password is "letmein".

After logging in you should see the following message:

[source, bash]
----
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
----

=== Web Console

Now in your browser go to {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}. You will get a warning about the
certificate and this is to be expected since we are using self-signed
certificates throughout the installation - so we will need to work around
this. Once you accept the certs, you should see the login screen. Again use the same username and
password from above. When done you should see something that looks like this:

And with that we are ready to get down to business. Let's start by just using
a plain Docker container image from Docker hub!
